    "title": "About Me",
    "description": "I'm a passionate backend developer with 6 months of hands-on experience in building robust systems using C# and .NET ecosystem. My expertise covers developing RESTful APIs, working with containerized applications (Docker), and implementing event-driven architectures using Kafka. I have practical experience with both SQL (PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases, and I'm actively expanding my knowledge in cloud technologies. What sets me apart is my strong foundation in computer science principles combined with quick learning ability - I can efficiently grasp new concepts and apply them to solve real-world problems. I'm particularly interested in positions where I can contribute to scalable system design while growing under the guidance of experienced engineers. My goal is to evolve into a well-rounded technical specialist capable of designing high-load distributed systems.",
